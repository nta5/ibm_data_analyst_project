## Project Overview ##

Data is gathered from the **2019 Developer Survey** conducted by Stack Overflow. \
The dataset used in this report is a modified subset of the 2019 Developer Survey, provided by the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project course on Coursera. \
The dataset is explored in **Python** using **Pandas and Matplotlib** to identify correlation between the fields. \
The dataset is imported to **IBM Cognos Analytics** to visualize:
- Current technology usage
- Future technology trend
- Demographics

## Presentation Overview ##
### Analyzing Current Technology Trends, From The 2019 Developer Survey ###

**Findings**
- Long-standing programming languages maintain their popularity, but there is a desire to adopt newer languages.
- The most popular databases remains unchanged, with a shift in desirability.
- Cross-platform and cloud development are on the rise.
- JavaScript and its frameworks continue to dominate the web field.
- Most developers are educated adults, with men holding the majority.

**Implications**
- This reflects the dynamic nature of the programming landscape, where developers are constantly exploring and embracing new technologies to stay competitive.
- A shift towards building scalable and adaptable software applications.
- Long-standing web frameworks are still in desire as they are effective and reliable.
- The tech field is male dominated. Younger generation is more capable of catching up to new technologies.

**Conclusion**
- In summary, while there may be changes and advancements in technology, the overall trends and patterns in the industry remain relatively stable over time.
- However, there is a clear desire for developers to reach a broader audience while reducing development time and costs.
